  <h2>The Australian Shepherd is a breed of herding dog from the United States. Developed in California in the 19th century,
  it is claimed the breed descends from a variety of herding breeds including collies imported into California alongside
  sheep imported from Australia and New Zealand, the breed taking its name from the former. Originally used solely as a
  herding dog, the Australian Shepherd has become one of the most popular companion dog breeds in North America.</h2>
